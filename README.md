# Colorectal Histology Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying colorectal histology images using computer vision techniques. The dataset consists of histopathological images labeled into different tissue types, and we use deep learning models to automate the classification process.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to develop a robust image classification model to distinguish between different colorectal tissue types. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, we aim to achieve high classification accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of:

- **Histopathological Images**: High-resolution colorectal tissue samples.
- **Classes**: Different types of tissues (e.g., tumor, stroma, muscle, etc.).
- **Image Format**: Typically provided in standard formats like JPEG or PNG.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Resize and normalize images.
   - Apply data augmentation techniques.

2. **Modeling**:

   - Train convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
   - Experiment with pre-trained models using transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).

3. **Evaluation**:

   - Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualize confusion matrices and loss curves.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics:

```
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

## Results

- **Best Model**:

```
   CNN with transfer learning (EfficientNetV2B3, Adam optimizer, batch size 32, learning rate 1e-3 (feature extraction) and 1e-4 (fine tuning))
```

- **Best Accuracy on Test Set**: 94.8%
- **Best Loss on Test Set**: 0.152
- **Techniques Used**: Data Augmentation, Transfer Learning

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of deep learning for colorectal histology classification. Future improvements could include expanding the dataset, experimenting with more complex architectures, and ensembling multiple models for better accuracy.
